# Homelab Sofware Versions

## Requirements

Kubernetes development continues to grow at a rapid pace, and keeping up to date can be a challenge. Therefore itâ€™s important to know which software versions can work together without breaking things.

* Rocky Linux 8 (not officially supported, use CentOS 7 instead)
* Kubernetes 1.22.4
* Calico CNI 3.21
* docker-ce 20.10.11
* kubernetes-cni 0.8.7
* Istio 1.11

Calico 3.21 has been tested against the following Kubernetes versions: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22.

Istio 1.11 has been tested with these Kubernetes releases: 1.19, 1.20, 1.21, 1.22.

Kubernetes 1.21 updated the latest validated version of Docker to 20.10.

SELinux set to enforcing mode and firewalld is enabled on all CentOS 7 servers.
